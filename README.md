Bundle adjustment demo using Ceres Solver

The project is a demo using Ceres Solver in Bundle adjustment, including inverse depth model and marginalization.
I refer to the framework [ba_demo_ceres](https://github.com/izhengfan/ba_demo_ceres) and the marginalization from [VINS_Mono](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/VINS-Mono)
